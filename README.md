# Learning Python repository by LuisElInvocador

This is a learning project. I want to learn python so I'm making this repo with the intention to upload all my folders. 

## Scope

This aims to be a personal documentation. I'm making this public so anyone can chech my progress and learn from this project. I don't mean to replace official documentation, but add an extra resource for new programmers as myself.
